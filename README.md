# KotlinGuessTheNumber

## Overview

This project is a simple **Guess the Number** game written in Kotlin.  
The goal is to practice Kotlin basics, console I/O, and simple logic control.  
It helps me grow my software engineering skills by building, testing, and version-controlling a small, working game.

## Purpose

I created this project to learn Kotlin syntax and experiment with console-based input and output.
It also demonstrates how to write a basic test for logic correctness.
